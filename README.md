ofxMtlMapping2D
=====================================

This addon is built off of a [morethanlogic fork](https://github.com/morethanlogic/ofxMtlMapping2D). I made a few changes ([mostly related to the new GLM syntax relating to vectors](https://openframeworks.cc/learning/02_graphics/how_to_use_glm/).  
  
Currently it compiles for OF 10.0.1  
  
See original fork for more details.
